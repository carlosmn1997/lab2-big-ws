Please, go to the [Wiki](https://github.com/UNIZAR-30246-WebEngineering/lab2-big-ws/wiki) in order to get the instructions for this assignment.

*Note:* 
This laboratory depends on the availability of the package `java.xml.bind`.
This package is available in Java versions prior to JDK 9.
Since the JDK 9 this package belongs to a module that is not be visible by default.
This breaks the task `genJaxb`. 
Therefore, you must ensure that you runs this code with JDK 8.

# What is new?

In order to make the names "getTransaltionRequest" and "getTranslationResponse" shorter, the files which are to change are the following ones:
- [translator.xsd](https://github.com/UNIZAR-30246-WebEngineering/lab2-big-ws/blob/master/src/main/resources/translator.xsd). The files named before are going to be renamed as "GTRequest" and "GTResponse".
- [TranslatorEndpoint.java](https://github.com/UNIZAR-30246-WebEngineering/lab2-big-ws/blob/master/src/main/java/translator/web/ws/TranslatorEndpoint.java). Import files and labes need to be renamed
- [TranslatorEndpointTest.java](https://github.com/UNIZAR-30246-WebEngineering/lab2-big-ws/blob/master/src/test/java/translator/web/ws/TranslatorEndpointTest.java). Import classes need to be renamed.
The code of that classes is autogenerated which means that only changing the xml file is enough.

Also using XPathParm in the [endpoint](https://github.com/UNIZAR-30246-WebEngineering/lab2-big-ws/blob/master/src/main/java/translator/web/ws/TranslatorEndpoint.java), using this [Reference Project](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ws-samples/blob/master/airline/server/src/main/java/org/springframework/ws/samples/airline/ws/AirlineEndpoint.java)
